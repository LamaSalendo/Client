# Cafeteria App

This is a random project I did for my school.

You can start the project with:

### `INSERT COMMAND`

On default react will start on `PORT: 400` and the server on `PORT: 401`

The project was inspired by McDonalds and should bring the same functionality into all cafeterias
and that's the reason I keep my code open-source.

## The project includes:

- Logging into the HTTP-Server with session
- Putting Items into the cart
- Having Item pictures
- Ordering with orderID
- Getting orderID on a screen (`SERVERADDRESS/screen` can only access when user has admin flag set to `true`)
- Getting orderID and items on a screen and deleting order when finished (`SERVERADDRESS/admin` can only access when user has admin flag set to `true`).
  For cashiers or someone similiar, who gives out the food

- Implementing Coupons
